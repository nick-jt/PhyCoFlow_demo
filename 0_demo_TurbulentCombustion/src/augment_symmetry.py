"""Exact symmetry augmentations for the three datasets.

Every transform here is a symmetry the underlying physics genuinely possesses,
so an augmented sample is another exact draw from the same distribution -- no
approximation, unlike cropping-and-rescaling (which changes the Reynolds
number) or additive noise.

Available symmetries by dataset:

  JHU isotropic turbulence (homogeneous + isotropic, cubic grid)
    - octahedral: the 48 signed axis permutations. Grid-safe, so grid-based
      baselines can use it too; this is the one we apply to every method for
      a matched comparison.
    - SO(3): arbitrary continuous rotation. Valid only because the model works
      on point clouds in ambient space -- rotating a voxel grid would require
      interpolation and smear the spectrum, so grid-based methods cannot use
      this without corrupting their data. Infinite augmentations, no
      resampling error.
    - pressure datum: incompressible pressure is defined up to an additive
      constant, so shifting the p channel is exact.

  FireBench wildfire LES (mean wind along x, line ignition across y)
    - lateral reflection y -> -y with v -> -v. The only valid spatial
      symmetry: the ground plane breaks z, and the wind direction breaks x.

  SHIFT-WING (left-right symmetric airframe at zero sideslip)
    - spanwise reflection y -> -y with Uy -> -Uy (and tau_y -> -tau_y on the
      surface pool).

All functions operate on [N, F] field tensors plus, where the transform moves
points, an [N, D] coordinate tensor.

    With `proper_only`, the 24 rotations (determinant +1) are used instead of
    the full 48-element group. The improper elements are reflections, and
    mirror symmetry is only a symmetry of the flow when the mean helicity
    vanishes -- helicity is a pseudo-scalar and changes sign under reflection.
    Restricting to proper rotations is the safe choice when that is unverified.
