"""Training-seed variance for the 2D fleets (P1-6).

The benchmark's rankings are read off single training runs. This asks the
question a reviewer will: is the gap between two methods larger than the spread
you get by retraining the same method with a different seed?

Reads the canonical fleet JSON (seed 42) and the replicate fleets (seeds 7 and
1337) written by src/submit_2d_seed_replicates_delta.sh, which differ from the
canonical configs ONLY in `seed`, demo number and save root. For every method
it reports mean +/- sample std of aggregate rel-L2 across the available seeds,
then compares the seed spread against the adjacent method-to-method gap in the
canonical ranking, and flags any pair whose gap is smaller than the pooled seed
spread -- those pairs are not resolved by the benchmark at one run per method,
whatever the point estimates say.

Usage:  python seed_variance_2d.py [kolmogorov2d|cylinder2d|both] [--json OUT]
