"""Write-time identity guard for evaluation artifacts.

Four times on 2026-09-10 a knob that changed WHAT was measured -- sensor
density, measurement operator, ensemble size -- was missing from WHERE the
result was written, and one run silently replaced another's JSON (DELTA_STATUS
sec.20, 21, 23). Each was fixed at its own naming site. This module is the fix
that does not depend on every name being right.

Every payload already records its own identity: protocol stamp, model, sensor
count, K, NFE, conditioning source and channels. Before a JSON is written over
an existing file, the identity stored INSIDE the existing file is compared with
the new payload's:

  same identity       -> overwrite (a re-run, or a resume refreshing a roll-up)
  different identity  -> the existing file is left untouched, the new payload
                         goes to a sidecar named after its own identity, and
                         the conflict is recorded so the caller exits non-zero

Neither artifact is ever destroyed. That matters because a collision is most
likely to be discovered at the END of a long job, where refusing to write at
all would throw the compute away.
