"""Surface-pool conditioning for the point-native baselines on SHIFT-WING.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Every baseline adapter in ``model_baseline.py`` builds its conditioning with
``helpers_baseline.build_sparse_condition``, which samples sensors from
RANDOM VOLUME POINTS of the field being reconstructed.  On SHIFT-WING that is
not the inverse problem: the task is surface-to-volume reconstruction, and our
model (``train_pointcloud_ffm.py``) only ever sees

  * the 65,536-point body-surface observation pool, 4 observable channels
    (Cp, tau_x, tau_y, tau_z  ->  field ids 3, 4, 5, 6), and
  * two exact scalar parameter tokens (Mach, alpha -> field ids 7, 8).

A baseline conditioned on interior samples would be handed information our
model never receives; it would be solving a strictly easier problem and the
comparison would invert.  This module gives the baselines the SAME draw.

WHAT IS REUSED VERBATIM
-----------------------
``build_wing_condition`` calls ``helpers.build_sparse_condition_from_pool``
and ``helpers.append_extra_tokens`` -- the very two functions our model's
trainer calls at ``train_pointcloud_ffm.py:580`` and ``:599`` -- with the same
per-channel budgets.  Nothing is reimplemented, so there is no second
implementation to drift.

Deliberate difference from our model's training loop, recorded here because it
is the one thing that is NOT identical: our run additionally pushes the pool
draw through ``apply_measurement_operators`` (sensor noise sigma in [0, 0.1],
20% ball occlusion, 30% channel dropout) before appending the parameter
tokens.  That is a property of OUR method (amortising the posterior over
measurement operators), not of the benchmark protocol, and the baseline
machinery has no equivalent.  The baselines therefore train on strictly
CLEANER conditioning than ours.  If that biases anything it biases in the
baselines' favour, so it cannot invert the comparison; it is stated in every
wing baseline config.

GATING
------
Everything here is inert unless the config sets

    shared:
      conditioning:
        source: surface_pool

so no other dataset's behaviour changes.  See ``surface_pool_enabled``.

    kept in a separate function so the shared volume path is untouched:

      1. the channel stack is ``n_cond_ch`` wide (9 field types), not
         ``n_fields`` (4).  Indexing a 4-wide stack with field id 6 is an
