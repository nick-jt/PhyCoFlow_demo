"""Binned spectral power loss for 3D field reconstruction.

A pointwise regression loss is dominated by the energy-containing scales: in
3D turbulence the inertial and dissipation ranges carry orders of magnitude
less power, so matching them buys almost nothing in MSE and the model is free
to under-resolve them. That is exactly the deficit we measure on JHU, where the
reconstructed inertial band holds only 0.61-0.74 of the true energy.

The fix that works is comparing *binned* power in radial wavenumber shells on a
log scale, so every decade of scale contributes comparably. Comparing raw
Fourier coefficients instead does not help -- it reweights the same pointwise
information and stays dominated by the large scales.

Two properties make this cheap for us:

  * The loss is evaluated on a contiguous block taken in GRID-INDEX space, so
    it is unaffected by the symmetry augmentations. Rotating or translating the
    point cloud changes coordinates, not the grid topology, and a radially
    binned spectrum is rotation invariant by construction.
  * Flow matching gives a differentiable endpoint for free. With a straight
    path x_t = (1-t)x_0 + t x_1 and predicted velocity v, the implied clean
    field is x_t + (1-t)v, so no sampling loop is needed inside training.

The estimate is exact at t -> 1 and noisiest at t -> 0, where the (1-t) factor
amplifies velocity error; `t_weighting` down-weights the noisy end.
